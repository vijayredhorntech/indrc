                                enhanced, insights are shared, and collaborative relationships are built. We are committed to providing a
                                safe, enjoyable, and inclusive environment for all participants, regardless of gender, race, ethnicity, age,
                                sexual orientation, religion, disability, socio-economic background, or experience. We have a zero-
                                tolerance policy for harassment, bullying, and abuse. Your right to participate without fear is non-
                                negotiable. Any individual engaging in unacceptable behaviour will be removed from the event without
                                hesitation.</div>
                            <div class="text" style="text-align: justify">Our Code of Conduct clearly defines inappropriate conduct. Offensive comments related to gender, age,
                                sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, race, or religion etc ; the display of sexual images in
                                public settings; intimidation or stalking; disruption during talks/oral or poster presentation; and
                                unwelcome sexual advances will be treated as harassment and will not be tolerated.</div>
                            <div class="text" style="text-align: justify">If approached to stop harassing behaviour, compliance is not optionalâ€”it is expected. Our organizers are
                                prepared to take swift action, which may include warnings or expulsion from the event without a refund,
                                to maintain a safe and respectful community.</div>
